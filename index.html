        <h2>BRIEF LOOK TO A DUTCH</h2>
        <font size="+2">When we look for the first time about the Dutch we find that they are told that they are stingy and that they always
           like to ride a bike everywhere and get high mainly with marijuana, tall with blue eyes and finally they are always associated with 
           cheeses since they are good making them.</font>

        <h2>GENDER STEREOTYPES</h2>
        <font size="+2">In this regard we easily tend to relate to their hypermasculinity in the case of men, but both as men and women both 
          relate to being tall and blond hair and blue eyes and women have good bodies also are introverted thanks to the machismo they suffer, 
          few are those with important positions, most do not reach a level of university study.</font>

        <h2>THE LEWIS MODEL AND DUTCH ARRIVING IN BARRANQUILLA</h2>
        <font size="+2">The Lewis model proposes that we can classify cultures into three groups (Multi-active, Linear-Active, Reactive) as a 
          way to categorize each culture. In and as this blog we talk about Dutch, these are categorized more as Linear-active. They are 
          task-oriented, highly-organized planners, who complete action chains by doing one thing at ta time, preferably in accordance with 
          a schedule</font>
        <p> </p>

        <p> </p>
        <font size="+2">In case a Dutchman comes to study in Barranquilla. This will have to face a huge change in their day to day, a 
          significant change and that will have to adapt is the inpuntality that many Barranquilleros have, also in the way of talking 
          about the Barranquilleros who talk about everything, jargon and be interrupted while you speak, prepare for unplanned activities.</font>

        <h2>HOFSTEDE'S MODEL - DUTCH Vs COLOMBIANS</h2>
        <img src="photo_week_4.1.png" alt="w11" width="508" height="523" >
        <p> </p>
        <font size="+2">We think this is not shock us because we are comparing a developing country in front of a developed country and obviously 
          that's the reason of why Colombia and Netherlands are so different. There aren't any similaritiesThe major differences are in the power 
          distance, the uncertainty avoidance and masculinity. And this is because the big difference between the upper class and lower-middle 
          class Further the masculinity is because the bad culture in Colombia of maleness.</font>

        <h2>SUBCULTURES</h2>
        <h2>- Emo's:</h2>
        <p> </p>
        <img src="photo_week_5.1.png" alt="w11" width="" height="" >
        <p> </p>
        <font size="+2">The culture of Emo’s started with music in the 80’s. The music consisted of hardcore, pop and rock. At the end of 
          90s, the emo-culture started to be a lifestyle with an own fashion style, especially for youth. The Emo culture is actually a 
          subculture of the Gothics, but there are more Emo’s in Holland than Gothics. The fashion of Emo’s is a mix of many others styles 
          with of alternative clothes. There are much identifying marks for the style of the Emo’s, like: dark clothes, long black hair 
          and one part of the hair mostly conceals one eye. the culture of the Gothics started with the New Wave, while the culture of 
          the Emo’s started with the Hardcore/punk music. Many people think that the stereotype of the Emo is of depressive, shy and wants 
          to isolate him/herself from society</font>
        </br>
        <font size="+2">In the Lewis model the Dutch Emos are reactive beacuse the usually never confronts you, they have subtle body language, 
          usually they think their answers before telling </font>
        
        <h2>- Farmers:</h2>
        <p> </p>
        <img src="photo_week_5.2.png" alt="w11" width="" height="" >
        <p> </p>
        <font size="+2">A typical Dutch subculture is the culture of the ‘farmers’. They live, of course, on a farm and they often wear 
          blouses with a blocked pattern which it calls ‘houthakkersblouse’ and jeans which are way too long and wide and they wear 
          worn-out shoes. There are many of people who think that it’s characteristic  for farmers that they are rude and that they can 
          act like a real bumpkin with bad manners, eating with open mouth, but that’s not always true of course. Farmers like typical 
          Dutch music and  farmers really like to drink beer. When they have a party, it is usually in a shed or a barn. For farmers it 
          is not a decision that they want to live like that or that they decide to live like that because of political or filosofical 
          norms. But a farm is mostly a family business, so the son  usually takes over the farm. And they are used to the ‘rude’ 
          behaviour because their parents and grandparents also behave like that so famers learned, that when they were young and 
          adopt this behaviour.</font>
        </br>
          <font size="+2">In the Lewis model the Dutch Farmers are linear active but less if you compare them with other 
          subcultures there because they have the characteristics but are more happier or are more outgoing.</font>
