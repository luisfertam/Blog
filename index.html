        <h2>BRIEF LOOK TO A DUTCH</h2>
        <font size="+2">When we look for the first time about the Dutch we find that they are told that they are stingy and that they always
           like to ride a bike everywhere and get high mainly with marijuana, tall with blue eyes and finally they are always associated with 
           cheeses since they are good making them.</font>

        <h2>GENDER STEREOTYPES</h2>
        <font size="+2">In this regard we easily tend to relate to their hypermasculinity in the case of men, but both as men and women both 
          relate to being tall and blond hair and blue eyes and women have good bodies also are introverted thanks to the machismo they suffer, 
          few are those with important positions, most do not reach a level of university study.</font>

        <h2>THE LEWIS MODEL AND DUTCH ARRIVING IN BARRANQUILLA</h2>
        <font size="+2">The Lewis model proposes that we can classify cultures into three groups (Multi-active, Linear-Active, Reactive) as a 
          way to categorize each culture. In and as this blog we talk about Dutch, these are categorized more as Linear-active. They are 
          task-oriented, highly-organized planners, who complete action chains by doing one thing at ta time, preferably in accordance with 
          a schedule</font>
        <p> </p>
        <img src="photo_week_3.1.png" alt="w11" width="680" height="500" >
        <p> </p>
        <font size="+2">In case a Dutchman comes to study in Barranquilla. This will have to face a huge change in their day to day, a 
          significant change and that will have to adapt is the inpuntality that many Barranquilleros have, also in the way of talking 
          about the Barranquilleros who talk about everything, jargon and be interrupted while you speak, prepare for unplanned activities.</font>
