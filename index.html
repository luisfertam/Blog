        <h2>BRIEF LOOK TO A DUTCH</h2>
        <font size="+2">When we look for the first time about the Dutch we find that they are told that they are stingy and that they always like to ride a bike everywhere and get high mainly with marijuana, tall with blue eyes and finally they are always associated with cheeses since they are good making them.</font>

        <h2>GENDER STEREOTYPES</h2>
        <font size="+2">In this regard we easily tend to relate to their hypermasculinity in the case of men, but both as men and women both relate to being tall and blond hair and blue eyes and women have good bodies also are introverted thanks to the machismo they suffer, few are those with important positions, most do not reach a level of university study.</font>
